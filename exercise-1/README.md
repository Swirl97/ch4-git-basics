2. Fork this repository (`ch4-git-basics`) to your own GitHub account by clicking the `fork` button on the GitHub interface.
> Done

3. Using the terminal, clone **your forked repository** to your machine (make sure you're in the desired directory on your terminal).
> Done

4. On your machine, open up this file (`exercise-1/README.md`) in a text editor of your choice.
> Done, opened in Atom! :)

5. In the `README.md` file, below these instructions, add an ordered list of what you ate for breakfast today.

 2. Granola
 3. Yogurt

6. Using your terminal, add and commit the changes you've made to your repository
> Will do after typing this!

7. Push changes up to GitHub, and view them in your web browser. Make sure you are looking at the repository under _your_ account!
> Will be completed after step 6 :smile:
